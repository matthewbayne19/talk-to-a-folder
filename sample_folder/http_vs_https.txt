HTTP vs HTTPS:

- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for data communication on the web. It is not secure by default.
- HTTPS (HTTP Secure) uses encryption via SSL/TLS to protect the communication between the browser and the server.
- HTTPS is essential for protecting user data, especially in forms, payments, and login processes.
- Modern browsers mark non-HTTPS sites as 'Not Secure'.
- Always use HTTPS to ensure privacy and data integrity.
